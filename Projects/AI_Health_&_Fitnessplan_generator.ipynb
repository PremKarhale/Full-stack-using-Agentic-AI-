      "{'meal_plan': 'It\\'s fantastic that you\\'ve provided such comprehensive details about your user! This is a great starting point. However, to create a *full and truly effective meal plan* to achieve their \"fit\" goal, we need to bridge a few gaps.\\n\\nThe current data allows us to make *informed suggestions*, but a precise meal plan requires more specificity on their definition of \"fit\" and their current routine.\\n\\n**Here\\'s why we can\\'t give a *full meal plan* yet, and what we need to do first:**\\n\\n**1. Defining \"Fit\":**\\n\\n*   **What does \"fit\" mean *to them*?** This is the most crucial missing piece. Does it mean:\\n    *   **Muscle Gain:** Higher protein, sufficient carbs for energy, and a slight caloric surplus.\\n    *   **Fat Loss:** Caloric deficit, balanced macros with emphasis on protein and fiber for satiety.\\n    *   **Improved Endurance:** Higher carbohydrate intake for sustained energy, adequate protein for muscle repair.\\n    *   **General Health & Well-being:** A balanced intake across all macronutrients and micronutrients.\\n*   **What is their current body composition?** While BMI is a good indicator, understanding muscle mass vs. fat mass would be more insightful.\\n\\n**2. Quantifying \"High\" Activity Level:**\\n\\n*   **What types of activities are they doing?** (e.g., running, weightlifting, team sports, yoga, etc.)\\n*   **How often do they do them?** (e.g., 5 days a week, daily)\\n*   **What is the duration and intensity of these activities?** (e.g., 30 minutes of moderate cardio, 1 hour of intense weightlifting)\\n\\n**3. Understanding their Vegetarian Diet in More Detail:**\\n\\n*   **Lacto-ovo vegetarian?** (eats dairy and eggs) This is generally easier to ensure complete protein.\\n*   **Vegan?** (no animal products at all) Requires more careful planning for B12, iron, omega-3s, and protein sources.\\n*   **Any specific food dislikes or preferences within vegetarianism?**\\n\\n**Once we have this crucial additional information, we can then proceed to create a tailored meal plan. In the meantime, I can provide a *sample meal structure and considerations* based on the data you\\'ve provided, assuming a general \"fit\" goal of maintaining good health, energy, and moderate body composition.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Sample Vegetarian Meal Structure & Considerations for a \"Fit\" Goal (Age 21, 60kg, 160cm, High Activity Level)**\\n\\n**Estimated Caloric Needs (This is an *estimation* and needs adjustment based on specific goals):**\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s estimate their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (commonly used and relatively accurate):\\n\\n*   **BMR (Women):** (10 * weight in kg) + (6.25 * height in cm) - (5 * age in years) - 161\\n*   BMR = (10 * 60) + (6.25 * 160) - (5 * 21) - 161\\n*   BMR = 600 + 1000 - 105 - 161\\n*   BMR = **1334 calories**\\n\\nNow, let\\'s factor in their **\\'high\\' activity level**. A multiplier of 1.725 is often used for \"very active\" individuals (exercising vigorously 6-7 days a week). We\\'ll use this as a starting point, acknowledging that the *actual* number of workouts and their intensity will refine this.\\n\\n*   **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):** BMR * Activity Factor\\n*   TDEE = 1334 * 1.725\\n*   TDEE = **~2300 calories**\\n\\n**This ~2300 calorie target is a *starting point* for maintenance and achieving a \"fit\" state. If their goal is fat loss, we\\'d create a deficit from this. If it\\'s muscle gain, we\\'d aim for a slight surplus.**\\n\\n**Macronutrient Distribution (General \"Fit\" Goal):**\\n\\nFor a general \"fit\" goal with a high activity level and vegetarian diet, a balanced approach is recommended:\\n\\n*   **Protein:** Crucial for muscle repair and satiety. Aim for 1.2-1.7g per kg of body weight.\\n    *   60kg * 1.5g/kg = **90 grams of protein** (This is a good target).\\n*   **Carbohydrates:** Fuel for their high activity level.\\n*   **Fats:** Important for hormone production and nutrient absorption.\\n\\n**Sample Vegetarian Meal Plan (Approx. ~2300 Calories, ~90g Protein):**\\n\\nThis plan focuses on whole, unprocessed vegetarian foods and provides a variety of nutrients.\\n\\n**Meal 1: Breakfast (Approx. 450-500 calories, 20-25g protein)**\\n\\n*   **Option 1: Tofu Scramble with Veggies & Whole Wheat Toast**\\n    *   150g firm tofu, crumbled and seasoned with turmeric, nutritional yeast, black salt (for eggy flavor), and pepper.\\n    *   1/2 cup mixed vegetables (spinach, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms) sautéed.\\n    *   2 slices whole wheat toast.\\n    *   1/4 avocado.\\n*   **Option 2: Overnight Oats with Protein Powder and Berries**\\n    *   1/2 cup rolled oats\\n    *   1 scoop vegetarian protein powder (soy, pea, or a blend)\\n    *   1 cup unsweetened almond/soy milk\\n    *   1 tbsp chia seeds\\n    *   1/2 cup mixed berries\\n    *   *Prepare the night before.*\\n\\n**Meal 2: Mid-Morning Snack (Approx. 200-250 calories, 10-15g protein)**\\n\\n*   **Option 1:** Greek yogurt (if lacto-ovo) with a handful of almonds.\\n*   **Option 2:** 1/2 cup cottage cheese (if lacto-ovo) with sliced cucumber.\\n*   **Option 3 (Vegan):** 1/2 cup edamame (steamed) with a sprinkle of sea salt.\\n*   **Option 4 (Vegan):** Small protein shake with plant-based milk.\\n\\n**Meal 3: Lunch (Approx. 550-600 calories, 25-30g protein)**\\n\\n*   **Option 1: Lentil Soup with Quinoa Salad**\\n    *   1.5 cups hearty lentil soup (made with lots of vegetables).\\n    *   1 cup cooked quinoa mixed with chopped cucumber, tomatoes, parsley, lemon juice, and a drizzle of olive oil.\\n    *   A side of whole grain crackers.\\n*   **Option 2: Chickpea Salad Sandwich on Whole Wheat**\\n    *   Mashed chickpeas (1 cup) mixed with vegan mayo (or regular mayo if lacto-ovo), celery, red onion, Dijon mustard, and herbs.\\n    *   Served on 2 slices of whole wheat bread with lettuce and tomato.\\n    *   A side of baby carrots and hummus.\\n\\n**Meal 4: Afternoon Snack (Approx. 200-250 calories, 10-15g protein)**\\n\\n*   **Option 1:** Apple slices with 2 tbsp peanut butter or almond butter.\\n*   **Option 2:** A hard-boiled egg (if lacto-ovo) and a small banana.\\n*   **Option 3 (Vegan):** A small handful of walnuts and dried apricots.\\n*   **Option 4 (Vegan):** Rice cakes with avocado and a sprinkle of chili flakes.\\n\\n**Meal 5: Dinner (Approx. 600-650 calories, 25-30g protein)**\\n\\n*   **Option 1: Tempeh Stir-fry with Brown Rice**\\n    *   150g tempeh, cubed and pan-fried or baked.\\n    *   2 cups mixed stir-fry vegetables (broccoli, snap peas, carrots, bell peppers).\\n    *   Stir-fry sauce made with soy sauce/tamari, ginger, garlic, and a touch of honey/maple syrup.\\n    *   1 cup cooked brown rice.\\n*   **Option 2: Black Bean Burgers with Sweet Potato Fries**\\n    *   2 homemade or store-bought black bean burgers (ensure good protein content).\\n    *   Whole wheat buns.\\n    *   Toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado.\\n    *   1 medium sweet potato, cut into fries, roasted with a little olive oil and spices.\\n\\n**Post-Workout (If applicable and needed for recovery):**\\n\\n*   A small smoothie with plant-based milk, a scoop of protein powder, and a banana.\\n*   A handful of almonds and a piece of fruit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Nutritional Considerations for Vegetarians Aiming for Fitness:**\\n\\n*   **Protein Sources:**\\n    *   **Legumes:** Lentils, beans (black, kidney, chickpeas), peas.\\n    *   **Soy Products:** Tofu, tempeh, edamame, soy milk.\\n    *   **Grains:** Quinoa, oats (contain more protein than other grains).\\n    *   **Nuts & Seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, flax seeds, pumpkin seeds.\\n    *   **Dairy & Eggs (if lacto-ovo):** Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs.\\n    *   **Vegetarian Protein Powders:** Pea, soy, hemp, rice, or blends.\\n*   **Iron:** Include iron-rich foods like lentils, spinach, fortified cereals, and tofu. Combine with Vitamin C sources (citrus fruits, bell peppers) to enhance absorption.\\n*   **Vitamin B12:** This is crucial as it\\'s primarily found in animal products. A B12 supplement is highly recommended for vegetarians, especially vegans. Fortified foods (plant milks, cereals, nutritional yeast) can also contribute.\\n*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Include sources like chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds, and walnuts. Algal oil supplements can provide EPA and DHA.\\n*   **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Ensure adequate intake from fortified plant milks, leafy greens (kale, broccoli), and potentially supplements, especially if avoiding dairy.\\n*   **Zinc:** Found in legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Soaking or sprouting these can improve zinc absorption.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To provide a *truly comprehensive meal plan*, please provide the following details:**\\n\\n1.  **What is their specific definition of \"fit\"?** (e.g., muscle gain, fat loss, endurance, general health)\\n2.  **Can you elaborate on their \"high\" activity level?** What are the activities, frequency, duration, and intensity?\\n3.  **Are they lacto-ovo vegetarian or vegan?**\\n\\nOnce I have this information, I can refine the calorie and macronutrient targets and create a much more specific and effective meal plan.', 'workout_plan': 'This is a fantastic starting point for a workout plan! Your \"fit\" goal combined with your high activity level and vegetarian diet gives us a great framework.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, here\\'s a comprehensive workout plan designed to support a general \"fit\" goal, which we\\'ll interpret as aiming for a balanced approach to:\\n\\n*   **Cardiovascular Health & Endurance:** Improving your heart health and ability to sustain activity.\\n*   **Muscular Strength & Tone:** Building and maintaining muscle for a strong and capable physique.\\n*   **Flexibility & Mobility:** Enhancing range of motion and preventing injuries.\\n*   **Overall Well-being:** Feeling energetic, healthy, and confident.\\n\\n**Important Considerations Before We Start:**\\n\\n*   **\"High\" Activity Level:** This plan assumes you\\'re already consistently active.
