Distributed Denial of Service \\n(DDoS) attacks, particularly zero-day variants with unknown signatures, pose severe threats to network \\navailability and service reliability. Traditional Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) fail to \\naddress these evolving threats effectively, with anomaly-based systems struggling against zero-day attacks \\nand signature-based systems limited by incomplete attack databases. \\n \\nThis seminar presents F-OSFA (Fog-based One Solution For All), a novel multi-pronged defence \\nmechanism designed to detect and mitigate diverse DDoS attacks at the fog computing level. The \\nproposed architecture addresses the limitations of cloud-based solutions by bringing intelligence closer to edge \\ndevices, reducing latency while enhancing security. F-OSFA comprises three specialized components: a \\nhybrid deep learning module combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Decision Trees for \\ntraditional DDoS detection, a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) module based on Contractive Autoencoders for zero-\\nday attack identification, and a signature-based resource usage analyzer for detecting attacks that mimic \\nnormal traffic patterns. \\n \\nThe system was comprehensively evaluated using two prominent datasets: CICDDoS2019 and \\nCICIDS2017. Extensive experiments demonstrate F-OSFA's superior performance compared to state-of- \\nthe-art machine learning and deep learning approaches.

Introduction \\n \\n \\nThe rapid digitization of modern society has fundamentally transformed how we interact, work, and conduct \\nbusiness. The Internet has evolved from a simple communication tool to the backbone of global digital \\ninfrastructure, supporting everything from routine daily activities to complex industrial operations. Cloud \\ncomputing has further revolutionized this landscape by providing scalable, on-demand computing resources \\nthat enable organizations to deploy services efficiently across the globe. \\n \\nThe emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in 1999 marked another pivotal moment in digital \\nevolution. IoT has created an interconnected ecosystem where billions of devices continuously collect, \\nprocess, and transmit data for real-time decision-making across diverse sectors including healthcare, \\nmanufacturing, transportation, smart cities, and energy management. This unprecedented connectivity has \\ngenerated exponential growth in network traffic, making network availability and security more critical than \\never before. \\n \\nHowever, this digital transformation has also created new vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Distributed \\nDenial of Service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as one of the most significant threats to network \\ninfrastructure. These attacks exploit large networks of compromised devices, known as botnets, to \\noverwhelm target systems with excessive traffic, rendering services unavailable to legitimate users. Recent \\nhigh-profile incidents, including attacks on major cloud providers with peak volumes exceeding 2 Tbps, \\ndemonstrate the escalating scale and sophistication of these threats. \\n \\nTraditional Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) struggle to address the evolving nature of \\nDDoS attacks. Anomaly-based systems, while effective against known attack patterns, fail to adequately \\ndetect zero-day attacks that employ novel signatures and tactics. Signature-based systems face limitations \\ndue to the difficulty of maintaining comprehensive databases that encompass all possible attack variations. \\nThe complexity of modern network traffic, characterized by high-dimensional feature spaces with over 80 \\nattributes in contemporary datasets, further complicates detection efforts. \\n \\n                             \\n                            \\n \\n                                                        \\n                                FIGURE 1.

Traditional defense mechanisms \\nprove inadequate against attacks that employ previously unseen signatures and techniques. \\n \\nIoT Vulnerability: The proliferation of IoT devices has created a vast attack surface with limited built-in \\nsecurity capabilities. These resource-constrained devices lack the computational power to implement \\ncomprehensive security measures locally, making them attractive targets for botnet recruitment. \\n \\nCloud Computing Limitations: While cloud-based security solutions offer scalability, they suffer from \\ninherent latency issues that can compromise real-time threat detection and response. The centralized nature \\nof cloud processing creates bottlenecks that attackers can exploit. \\n \\nZero-Day Attack Challenge: The cybersecurity community lacks effective solutions for detecting and \\nmitigating zero-day DDoS attacks. These attacks, by definition, have no prior training data or known \\nsignatures, rendering conventional machine learning approaches ineffective. \\n \\nResearch Gap: Existing research primarily focuses on traditional attack detection methods, with limited \\ncomprehensive solutions that address the multi-dimensional nature of modern DDoS threats. There is a \\nsignificant need for holistic defense mechanisms that can handle diverse attack categories simultaneously. \\n \\nPractical Implementation Need: The theoretical advancements in cybersecurity must translate into practical, \\ndeployable solutions that can operate effectively in real-world network environments with varying traffic \\npatterns and resource constraints. \\n \\n \\n \\n1.3 Objective(s) of the work \\n \\nThe primary objectives of this seminar work are structured to address the identified challenges through a \\ncomprehensive research approach: \\n \\nTo analyze the current state of DDoS attack detection technologies and identify their limitations in \\nhandling zero-day attacks and complex network traffic patterns. \\n \\nTo study fog computing paradigms and their potential advantages for implementing distributed security \\nsolutions that bring intelligence closer to network edge devices. \\n \\nTo examine the F-OSFA (Fog-based One Solution For All) architecture and understand its multi- pronged \\napproach to DDoS detection, including traditional attack detection, zero-day attack identification, and \\nmimicked traffic analysis. \\n \\nTo investigate the hybrid machine learning framework that combines Convolutional Neural Networks \\n(CNN) and Decision Trees for traditional DDoS attack detection and classification. \\n \\nTo explore zero-shot learning methodologies based on Contractive Autoencoders for detecting previously \\nunseen attack patterns without requiring prior training data.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '3.0.26 (5.1.12)', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creationdate': '2025-10-03T01:29:38+05:30', 'source': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'file_path': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Seminar Report Format AY 2025-26.docx', 'author': 'Admin', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-10-02T22:09:20+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20251002220920+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20251003012938+05'30'\", 'page': 10}, page_content='3 \\n \\n \\nTo evaluate the performance metrics and effectiveness of the F-OSFA system using standard \\ncybersecurity datasets such as CICDDoS2019 and CICIDS2017. \\n \\nTo analyze the practical implications of fog-level deployment for real-time threat detection and response \\nin IoT ecosystems and distributed networks. \\n \\nTo assess the generalizability and scalability of the proposed solution across different network environments \\nand attack scenarios. \\n \\nTo identify future research directions and potential enhancements that could further improve the \\neffectiveness of multi-pronged defense mechanisms against evolving cyber threats. \\n \\n1.4 Scope of the Work \\nThe scope of this seminar work extends beyond theoretical evaluation and highlights the practical importance \\nof deploying advanced DDoS detection systems at the fog level.

DDoS \\nattacks are among the most dangerous threats facing modern networks. These attacks use multiple \\ncompromised computers to flood a target system, making it unavailable to legitimate users. Traditional \\nsecurity systems struggle to keep up with new attack methods, especially zero-day attacks that have never \\nbeen seen before. \\nResearchers have tried various approaches to solve this problem, including machine learning and deep learning \\ntechniques. However, most existing solutions focus on known attacks and fail when facing completely new \\nattack patterns. This creates a significant gap in cybersecurity defense. \\n \\n2.2 Different Approaches of DDoS Attack Detection \\n2.2.1 Traditional Machine Learning Methods \\n \\nSeveral researchers have used basic machine learning algorithms for DDoS detection. Elmasri et al. tested \\nalgorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors and Local Outlier Factor, achieving around 90% accuracy. While these \\nresults seem decent, they only work well on attacks the system has seen during training. \\n \\nNazarudeen and Sundar used Decision Trees and Random Forest on the CICDDoS2019 dataset and got 99% \\naccuracy. However, their approach fails when attackers use new techniques not present in the training data. \\nThis limitation makes traditional methods unreliable for real-world deployment. \\n \\n2.2.2 Deep Learning Approaches \\n \\nDeep learning has shown more promise for complex pattern recognition. Kim et al. developed CNN-based \\nsystems that can identify spatial patterns in network traffic. Their approach works better than traditional \\nmethods because neural networks can learn more complex relationships in the data. \\nDing and Zhai implemented CNNs for intrusion detection and found that these networks could automatically \\nextract useful features from network traffic. This automatic feature extraction is important because manually \\ndesigning features for every possible attack type is impractical. \\n \\n2.2.3 Autoencoder-Based Detection \\n \\nAutoencoders have gained attention for anomaly detection because they can learn what normal traffic looks \\nlike. Singh and Jang combined CNNs with autoencoders to detect both spatial and temporal patterns in network \\ndata. Their approach achieved good results but still struggled with completely unknown attacks. \\nWang et al. used contractive autoencoders with support vector machines, reaching 88% accuracy on standard \\ndatasets. While this is reasonable performance, it's not sufficient for critical infrastructure protection where \\neven small error rates can be costly.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': '3.0.26 (5.1.12)', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creationdate': '2025-10-03T01:29:38+05:30', 'source': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'file_path': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Seminar Report Format AY 2025-26.docx', 'author': 'Admin', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-10-02T22:09:20+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20251002220920+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20251003012938+05'30'\", 'page': 12}, page_content=\"5 \\n \\n2.3 State-of-Art Algorithms and Zero-Day Detection \\n2.3.1 Zero-Shot Learning Approaches \\n \\nZhang et al. tried zero-shot learning using sparse autoencoders to detect unknown attacks. They achieved 88% \\naccuracy, which was a step forward but still left significant room for improvement. The main challenge is that \\nzero-shot learning requires the system to identify attacks it has never encountered before. \\nHindy et al. developed autoencoder systems specifically for zero-day detection, with accuracy ranging from \\n75% to 98% depending on the dataset. This wide variation shows that current approaches lack consistency \\nacross different network environments. \\n \\n2.3.2 Fog Computing Solutions \\n \\nSome researchers have moved security processing closer to network edges using fog computing. Shafi et al. \\ncreated fog-based intrusion detection systems that reduce the delay between attack detection and response. \\nThis is important because traditional cloud-based systems can be too slow for real-time threat response. \\nHowever, most fog computing approaches still use the same detection algorithms that struggle with zero-day \\nattacks. Simply moving processing closer to the edge doesn't solve the fundamental problem of detecting \\nunknown attack patterns. \\n \\n2.4 Research Gaps and Limitations \\nCurrent research has several major limitations. First, most systems only work well on known attack types \\nand perform poorly against new attack variants. Second, many approaches achieve high accuracy in \\nlaboratory conditions but fail in real-world deployments where network traffic is more complex and \\nunpredictable. \\nThird, existing zero-day detection methods show inconsistent results across different datasets, suggesting \\nthey lack generalizability. Finally, most research focuses on individual components rather than \\ncomprehensive defense systems that can handle multiple attack types simultaneously. \\nThe F-OSFA system addresses these gaps by combining multiple detection approaches and deploying them \\nat the fog level for faster response times. This multi-pronged strategy represents a significant advancement \\nover single-method approaches that dominate current literature. \\n \\n \\n                   \\n \\n      \\n                                FIGURE 2. t-SNE visualization for CIC-IDS2017.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': '3.0.26 (5.1.12)', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creationdate': '2025-10-03T01:29:38+05:30', 'source': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'file_path': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Seminar Report Format AY 2025-26.docx', 'author': 'Admin', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-10-02T22:09:20+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20251002220920+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20251003012938+05'30'\", 'page': 13}, page_content='6 \\n \\nCHAPTER 3  \\n                                           EXPERIMENTAL SETUP \\n3.1 Introduction to F-OSFA System \\n                                                           \\n \\n                                         FIGURE 3. Fog Infrastructure. \\nF-OSFA (Fog-based One Solution For All) is a three-part defence system designed to handle different types of \\nDDoS attacks. Instead of relying on just one detection method, it uses multiple approaches working together. \\nThis makes sense because attackers use various techniques, so defenders need multiple tools to catch them all. \\nThe system works at the fog computing level, which means it processes data closer to where attacks happen \\nrather than sending everything to distant cloud servers. This reduces the time between detecting an attack and \\nstopping it, which is crucial for network protection. \\n \\n3.2 System Architecture and Components \\n3.2.1 Three-Prong Defense Mechanism \\n \\nThe F-OSFA system has three main parts, each designed for specific attack types: \\nProng 1 - Hybrid Module: This combines two different approaches - a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) \\nand Decision Trees. The CNN is good at finding complex patterns in network traffic, while Decision Trees \\nhandle straightforward attack signatures. Together, they catch most traditional DDoS attacks that security \\nsystems have seen before. \\n \\nProng 2 - Zero-Shot Learning Module: This is the most innovative part. It uses a special type of \\nautoencoder that learns what normal network traffic looks like. When something unusual appears (like a \\nzero-day attack), the system can spot it even though it has never seen that exact attack before. This solves a \\nmajor problem in cybersecurity.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '3.0.26 (5.1.12)', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creationdate': '2025-10-03T01:29:38+05:30', 'source': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'file_path': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Seminar Report Format AY 2025-26.docx', 'author': 'Admin', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-10-02T22:09:20+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20251002220920+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20251003012938+05'30'\", 'page': 14}, page_content=\"7 \\n \\n                                   \\n \\n \\n                          FIGURE 4. Proposed contractive autoencoder. \\n \\nProng 3 - Signature-Based Analyzer: Some attacks try to look like normal traffic to avoid detection. This \\ncomponent monitors resource usage patterns to catch these sneaky attacks that fool other detection methods. \\n3.2.2 Decision Making Process \\n \\nWhen network traffic comes in, all three components analyze it simultaneously. Each gives its opinion about  \\nwhether the traffic is normal or malicious. A voting system then makes the final decision. If two or more \\ncomponents think it's an attack, the traffic gets blocked. This approach reduces false positives while \\nmaintaining high detection rates. \\n \\n3.3 Datasets and Data Preparation \\n3.3.1 Dataset Selection \\nThe researchers used two well-known datasets to test their system: \\nCICDDoS2019: This dataset contains modern DDoS attacks with over 80 different features for each network \\npacket. It includes 12 types of attacks in the training data and 7 different attacks in the test data. This variety \\nhelps evaluate how well the system handles different attack styles. The dataset was developed by the Canadian \\nInstitute for Cybersecurity and spans two days of network traffic collection. It encompasses both Reflection-\\nbased and Exploitation-based DDoS attack categories, making it particularly valuable for testing against \\ncontemporary attack techniques. The original dataset contains millions of instances, but for computational \\nfeasibility and balanced evaluation, the researchers sampled approximately 6.5 million attack packets along \\nwith all available benign traffic instances. \\nCICIDS2017: This is a comprehensive dataset that includes DDoS attacks along with other types of cyber \\nattacks.

Most security systems fail when attackers use novel techniques because they only recognize patterns \\nfrom their training data. F-OSFA's zero-shot learning component solves this by learning what normal traffic \\nlooks like, then flagging anything unusual. This achieved 96.77% accuracy against zero-day attacks, which \\nis significantly better than existing systems. \\n \\n4.1.2 Multi-Dimensional Threat Coverage \\n \\nInstead of using just one detection method, F-OSFA combines three different approaches. This means it can \\nhandle traditional attacks, zero-day attacks, and sneaky attacks that try to look like normal traffic. Having \\nmultiple detection layers makes it much harder for attackers to slip through undetected. \\n \\n4.1.3 Reduced Response Time \\n \\nBy operating at the fog computing level, F-OSFA processes threats closer to where they occur rather than \\nsending data to distant cloud servers. This cuts down the time between detecting an attack and blocking it. In \\ncybersecurity, even seconds matter when dealing with high-volume attacks. \\n \\n4.1.4 High Overall Accuracy \\n \\nThe experimental results show impressive performance: 99.72% accuracy on the CICDDoS2019 dataset and \\n99.96% on DDoS attacks in CICIDS2017. These numbers are better than most existing solutions and \\ndemonstrate the system's reliability. \\n \\n4.1.5 Practical Deployment Feasibility \\n \\nF-OSFA was tested on standard hardware using common programming tools, proving it doesn't require \\nexpensive specialized equipment. This makes it accessible for organizations with limited budgets, unlike \\nsome research solutions that only work in laboratory environments. \\n \\n4.1.6 Generalizability Across Different Networks \\n \\nThe system performed well on multiple datasets with different characteristics, suggesting it can adapt to \\nvarious network environments. Many other solutions work well on specific datasets but fail when deployed \\nin different settings. \\n \\n4.2 Limitations and Challenges \\n4.2.1 Training Data Requirements \\n \\nF-OSFA needs large amounts of clean, normal network traffic to train its zero-shot learning component \\neffectively. Collecting and verifying this data can be time-consuming and expensive. Organizations with \\nlimited historical data might struggle to implement the system properly.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': '3.0.26 (5.1.12)', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creationdate': '2025-10-03T01:29:38+05:30', 'source': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'file_path': 'FINAL REPORT FOSFA.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Seminar Report Format AY 2025-26.docx', 'author': 'Admin', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-10-02T22:09:20+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20251002220920+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20251003012938+05'30'\", 'page': 19}, page_content=\"12\\n \\n4.2.2 Computational Overhead \\n \\nRunning three different detection components simultaneously requires more processing power than single- \\nmethod approaches. While the system works on standard hardware, it still uses more resources than simpler \\nalternatives. This could be problematic for very resource-constrained environments. \\n \\n4.2.3 Threshold Optimization Complexity \\n \\nThe zero-shot learning module relies on setting the right threshold to distinguish between normal and \\nabnormal traffic. Finding this optimal threshold requires careful tuning and might need adjustment as \\nnetwork patterns change over time. Getting this wrong can lead to either missing attacks or generating too \\nmany false alarms. \\n \\n4.2.4 Limited Scope of Attack Types \\n \\nWhile F-OSFA handles DDoS attacks very well, it's specifically designed for this threat type. It doesn't address \\nother important cybersecurity challenges like malware, data theft, or advanced persistent threats. Organizations \\nwould need additional security tools to cover these areas. \\n \\n4.2.5 Potential for Sophisticated Evasion \\n \\nAdvanced attackers who understand how F-OSFA works might develop techniques to fool all three detection \\ncomponents simultaneously. While this would be difficult, determined adversaries with sufficient resources \\ncould potentially find ways around the system. \\n \\n4.2.6 Real-World Deployment Challenges \\n \\nThe research was conducted in controlled laboratory conditions using cleaned datasets.

These systems are attractive targets for DDoS attacks because disrupting them can affect \\nthousands of people. F-OSFA can protect smart city networks by detecting attacks before they overwhelm \\ncritical infrastructure. \\n \\nFor example, traffic light systems, smart parking meters, and environmental sensors all generate network \\ntraffic that F-OSFA can monitor. When attackers try to flood these systems, the fog-level deployment \\nensures quick response times that prevent service disruptions. \\n \\n5.1.2 Healthcare IoT Networks \\n \\nHospitals and healthcare facilities increasingly use IoT devices for patient monitoring, medical equipment \\nmanagement, and data collection. These networks handle sensitive patient data and control life-critical \\nsystems, making security paramount. \\n \\nF-OSFA's ability to detect zero-day attacks is particularly valuable in healthcare because attackers often target \\nmedical facilities with new techniques. The system can protect patient monitors, insulin pumps, and other \\nconnected medical devices without interfering with their normal operation. \\n \\n5.1.3 Industrial IoT and Manufacturing \\n \\nManufacturing facilities use IoT sensors and control systems for production monitoring and automation. DDoS \\nattacks on these systems can halt production lines, causing significant financial losses. \\n \\nThe fog-based architecture of F-OSFA works well in industrial settings because it can process security data \\nlocally without relying on external cloud connections that might be unreliable in industrial environments. \\n \\n5.1.4 Financial Services and Banking \\n \\nBanks and financial institutions face constant cyber threats, including sophisticated DDoS attacks designed to \\ndisrupt online services. F-OSFA's high accuracy rates and multi-layered detection approach provide the \\nreliability these institutions need. \\n \\nThe system's ability to handle multiple attack types simultaneously is especially useful for financial services \\nthat face coordinated attacks using various techniques. \\n \\n5.1.5 Educational Institutions \\n \\nUniversities and schools with large networks of connected devices can benefit from F-OSFA's comprehensive \\nprotection.

The system works best when deployed gradually, starting with less critical \\nnetwork segments before protecting entire infrastructures. \\n \\n5.2.2 Integration with Existing Security Systems \\n \\nF-OSFA can complement existing security tools rather than replacing them entirely. It handles DDoS detection \\nwhile other systems manage different threat types like malware or data breaches.

Organizations need personnel who can adjust thresholds, interpret alerts, and \\ntroubleshoot issues as they arise. \\n \\n5.3 Future Scope and Enhancement Opportunities \\n5.3.1 Expansion to Other Cyber Threats \\n \\nThe current F-OSFA design focuses specifically on DDoS attacks, but the multi-prong architecture could be \\nadapted for other threat types. Future versions might include modules for detecting malware, data exfiltration, \\nor advanced persistent threats. \\n \\nThis expansion would require developing new detection components while maintaining the system's core \\nadvantage of handling unknown attack variants. \\n \\n5.3.2 Federated Learning Integration \\n \\nFuture versions could implement federated learning, allowing multiple F-OSFA deployments to share threat \\nintelligence without exposing sensitive local data. This would help all installations learn about new attack \\npatterns discovered elsewhere. \\n \\nFederated learning would be particularly valuable for organizations that want to benefit from collective security \\nknowledge while maintaining data privacy. \\n \\n5.3.3 Adaptive Threshold Management \\n \\nCurrent threshold optimization requires manual adjustment, but future versions could automatically adapt \\nthresholds based on changing network conditions.

The research \\ndemonstrates that combining multiple detection approaches in a single system provides significantly better \\nprotection than relying on individual methods. \\n \\nThe key findings show that F-OSFA achieved impressive results: 99.72% accuracy against known attacks \\nand 96.77% accuracy against previously unseen zero-day attacks. These numbers represent a substantial \\nimprovement over existing solutions, which typically struggle with unknown attack patterns. The multi- \\nprong architecture proved effective by using CNN and Decision Trees for traditional attacks, contractive \\nautoencoders for zero-day detection, and signature analysis for mimicked traffic. \\n \\nThe fog-level deployment addresses a critical limitation of cloud-based security systems by reducing \\nresponse times and bringing intelligence closer to potential attack sources. This approach is particularly \\nvaluable for IoT environments where quick threat response is essential for maintaining service availability. \\n \\nHowever, the system is not without limitations. It requires substantial training data, has higher \\ncomputational overhead than simpler alternatives, and focuses specifically on DDoS attacks rather than \\nproviding comprehensive cybersecurity coverage. Real-world deployment may also reveal challenges not \\napparent in laboratory testing. \\n \\nLooking forward, F-OSFA represents an important step toward adaptive cybersecurity systems that can \\nhandle unknown threats. The research opens several promising directions, including federated learning \\nintegration, expansion to other attack types, and optimization for emerging technologies like 5G networks. \\n \\nThe practical applications span multiple sectors, from smart cities and healthcare to financial services and \\nindustrial systems.

However, most existing solutions focus on known attacks and fail when facing completely new \\nattack patterns. This creates a significant gap in cybersecurity defense. \\n \\n2.2 Different Approaches of DDoS Attack Detection \\n2.2.1 Traditional Machine Learning Methods \\n \\nSeveral researchers have used basic machine learning algorithms for DDoS detection.

However, their approach fails when attackers use new techniques not present in the training data. \\nThis limitation makes traditional methods unreliable for real-world deployment. \\n \\n2.2.2 Deep Learning Approaches \\n \\nDeep learning has shown more promise for complex pattern recognition.
